# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

I have used third party API's to build a weather dashboard. This features updated HTML and CSS, in addition to Javascript.

I used the  [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve data for any city of my choice. I also used `localStorage` in order to store past data and to display any previously searched cities.

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
